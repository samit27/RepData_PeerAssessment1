```

##Loading and Processing the data
1. download and read the csv file
2. Remove missing values

```{r}
# Load the data file into a data frame
setwd("C:/R")
#download the file
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip","./course5project1/activitymonitoringdata.zip")

#unzipping the file
unzip("./course5project1/activitymonitoringdata.zip",exdir="./course5project1")

activity <- read.csv("./course5project1/activity.csv")
#removing the missing values
activityClean <- activity[complete.cases(activity), ]

```

##Histogram of total number of steps taken each day
Calculate total number of steps taken by date
Plot a histogram of the same
``` {r}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
stepsByDate <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityClean, sum)

# Plot a histogram of total number of steps taken per day
hist(stepsByDate$steps, main = "Histogram of total number of steps per day", xlab = "Steps per day")
```

##Mean and median number of steps taken each day
1. Mean
```{r}
mean(stepsByDate$steps)
```
2. Median
```{r}
median(stepsByDate$steps)

```

##How does the average number of steps taken vary over time?
```{r}
# Calculate average number of steps taken by 5-minute intervals
stepsByInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activityClean, mean)

# Plot the time series with appropriate labels and heading
plot(stepsByInterval$interval, stepsByInterval$steps, type='l', main="Average number of steps taken by Interval", xlab="5-minute Intervals", ylab="Average number of steps taken")

maxInterval <- which.max(stepsByInterval$steps)
```

The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, that contains the maximum number of steps is
```{r}
stepsByInterval[maxInterval,]$interval
```

##Imputing missing values

### 1. calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
```{r}
nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])
```
### 2. Strategy for imputing missing data Missing data is imputed using average for that 5-minute interval across all days.


```{r}
activityImputed <- activity
for (i in 1:nrow(activityImputed)) {
    if(is.na(activityImputed$steps[i])) {
        avgSteps <- stepsByInterval$steps[which(stepsByInterval$interval == activityImputed$interval[i])]
        activityImputed$steps[i] <- avgSteps 
    }
}
```

##Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed

```{r}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
stepsByDateImputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityImputed, sum)

# Plot a histogram of total number of steps taken per day (imputed values)
hist(stepsByDateImputed$steps, main = "Histogram of total number of steps per day", xlab = "Steps per day")
```

##Mean and median number of steps taken each day after imputation

1. Mean
```{r}
mean(stepsByDateImputed$steps)
```

2. Median
```{r}
median(stepsByDateImputed$steps)
```

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Comparison of the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

```{r}
weekends <- c("Saturday","Sunday")

activityImputed$weekday <- as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(activityImputed$date)),weekends), "Weekend", "Weekday"))

stepsByInterval_w <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + weekday, activityImputed, mean)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stepsByInterval_w, aes(y=steps, x=interval)) + geom_line(aes(color=weekday,group=weekday)) + facet_grid(weekday ~ .) + labs(x = "Interval", y = "Number of Steps", title = "Number of steps across weekdays and weekends")
```

From this plot, we can observe that activity start time is generally later on weekends and less intense in the weekend mornings.
